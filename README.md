# Como Client
**A Minecraft "hacked client"** in the form of a Fabric mod developed with the aim of giving its users an advantage in most (if not all) situations (*but since I made it it probably won't to be honest...*), while still aiming to be as simplistic as possible.

## Installation
Haven't got it to automatically build yet (if I am honest) but you can always download it and build it yourself using `./gradlew build` (on smelly Windows) and `./gradle build` (on Linux based systems)

## Features
I will make sure to make more as time goes on but these are the current modules that I am working on.
- Anti-Chatbot
- Anti-Dropped Item Render
- Blink
- CamFlight
- EntityESP
- Flight
- NoWeather/(Anti-British)
- Speed
- Superjump
- HideTotem/SmallTotem
- NoFall
- NoBoss
- ElytraFlight
- XRay
- NoEnchantBook
- NoBreak
- AutoShear

### Thanks
While developing this I was aided by the source code of the [Wurst Project](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7), since this was my first ever mod for Minecraft that I had made, I was quite unfamiliar with the way the APIs work etc. therefore, by looking at Wurst's source code, I could quickly understand the API and start making this mod.
